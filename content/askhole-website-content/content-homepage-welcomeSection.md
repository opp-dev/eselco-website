Hi. my name is Sury and I am an experience engineer. I am testing at the moment, how to get Obsidian working as my CMS. 
Now to see how fast is this system. What are the steps?

That worked now. I have everything set up properly. Trying the workflow.

The **print dialog box** is the classic example of progressive disclosure. When you issue the command to print a document, you'll get a dialog box with a small set of choices — mainly, how many copies to print, but possibly a few other variations, such as whether to print the entire document or a subset, and which printer to use. Sadly, print dialog boxes have grown bloated over the past decade, and some applications offer an initial dialog box with highly detailed options that would be better placed in a secondary dialog box.

The initial print dialog box typically contains one or more buttons for advanced options. These buttons lead to secondary dialogs that let users specify rarely used settings, such as scaling and printing the pages in reverse sequence. If the user clicks the advanced options button, the system discloses the additional features.

### Benefits of Progressive Disclosure

In a system designed with progressive disclosure, the very fact that something appears on the initial display tells users that it's **important**.

For **novice users**, this helps prioritize their attention so that they spend time only on features that are most likely to be useful to them. By hiding the advanced settings, progressive disclosure helps novice users avoid mistakes and saves them the time they would have spent contemplating features that they don't need.

For **advanced users**, the smaller initial display also saves them time because they avoid having to scan past a large list of features they rarely use.
